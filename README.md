## Introduction

The **React-Intermediate** repository showcases several projects that cover a range of React concepts, including state management with Redux Toolkit, use of hooks such as `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`, and advanced topics like the Context API. These projects are intended for developers who have a basic understanding of React and want to move towards more complex and scalable applications.

## Projects

### 04bgChanger

- **Description**: A simple background color changer that utilizes basic React state management to switch between different background colors.
- **Concepts Covered**: `useState` hook, event handling.

### 05PasswordGenerator

- **Description**: A password generator application that demonstrates the use of various hooks to manage state and effects, including `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- **Concepts Covered**: State management, callback hooks, side effects, references.

### 06currencyConvertor

- **Description**: A currency converter app that uses custom hooks for encapsulating logic related to currency conversion.
- **Concepts Covered**: Custom hooks, state and effect management.

### 07reactRouter

- **Description**: A project focused on implementing React Router for navigating between different components/pages within a React application.
- **Concepts Covered**: React Router, routing and navigation.

### 08miniContext

- **Description**: A mini application that introduces the use of Context API to manage and share state across components without prop drilling.
- **Concepts Covered**: Context API, global state management.

### 09themeswitcher

- **Description**: A theme switcher application that allows users to toggle between different themes using context.
- **Concepts Covered**: Context API, state management, theming.

### 10todocontextLocal

- **Description**: A to-do list application that uses the Context API for state management and stores data locally to maintain the state even after a refresh.
- **Concepts Covered**: Context API, local storage.

### reduxToolkitTodo

- **Description**: A to-do list application utilizing Redux Toolkit for state management, demonstrating how Redux can be used for handling complex state in a scalable manner.
- **Concepts Covered**: Redux Toolkit, state management, actions, reducers.
